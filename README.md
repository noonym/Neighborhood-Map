## Neighborhood Map

This website shows the neighborhood that I live in and the most 5 known places there.
I used Google Maps API as well as Wikipedia API. I also used `knockoutjs` for the MVVM. The website is responsive and compatible with all devices.

## How To Use The Neighborhood Map

1. Search locations by writing down the location name on the search bar.
2. You can select the desired location be either clicking on its name on the list, or clicking on its marker on the map.
3. An infowindow will appear showing an article from wikipedia about this location.
